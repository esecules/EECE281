EECE 281 GitHub Guidelines

--Clone into the repository with the clone URL in the bottom right of the screne

--Make your first commit by putting your name and email at the bottom of this file

--COMMIT EARLY AND OFTEN

--Please only work on your own blocks to prevent merge conflicts. If you need something changed contact the block owner. since we will be working on the same file (most likely) it would be helpful if you signed your work.

	example:

	;Eric Secules
	
		code
		code
		code
		.
		.
		.
		code

	;end Eric Secules


--Use GitHub to report bugs 

--Write meaningful commit statements

	example:
		git commit -m "fixed bug #4 and added SPI interface"

--commit the .asm files, github supports that.
